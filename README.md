https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WcB_TFXJZQvi5ZLyvKE6VMRizG8DvJc0?usp=sharing
Once this is done put the folder in your google drive ( if its zipped, make sure to unzip it) 
From there you can simply run the SD_Thumbs_Up.ipynb file. 
While running that file, it may prompt for images to download, you can use the images in the thumbs up folder. 
During inference if you want to generate an image of someone giving a thumbsup type "tup" in front of subject, Ex: 
"a photo of a tup person", "A photo of tup Kevin Hart", "A photo of tup Bill Nye", etc.
