# Thumbs-up-SD
Fine Tuning SD to produce better images of people giving a thumbs up

# How to Run
Go to this link and download the stable_diffision_weights folder: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WcB_TFXJZQvi5ZLyvKE6VMRizG8DvJc0?usp=sharing
Once this is done put the folder in your google drive ( if its zipped, make sure to unzip it) 
Please note the model is around 3-3.5 GBs, make sure you have the needed space in the drive
From there you can simply run the SD_Thumbs_Up.ipynb file. 

While running that file, it may prompt for images to download, you can use the images in the thumbs up folder,
please note this is only training the model, but if you already downloaded the model above you do not need to run that block. 
During inference if you want to generate an image of someone giving a thumbsup type "tup" in front of subject, Ex: 
"a photo of a tup person", "A photo of tup Kevin Hart", "A photo of tup Bill Nye", etc.
